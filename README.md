# Download Google Photos with Metadata

## Overview
If you've ever used Google Takeout to download your Google Photos, you might have noticed that the downloaded files often come without important metadata like timestamps, locations, etc. This can be frustrating, especially when you're looking to keep your photo organization intact.

After experimenting with different methods, I found a much more reliable way to download your Google Photos **with metadata preserved**. Rather than using Google Takeout, follow the steps below to ensure your photos include metadata when downloaded.

## Steps to Download Google Photos with Metadata

1. **Create a New Album**
   - Log in to your Google Photos account.
   - Create a new album for the photos you want to download.
   - Add all the photos you want to download to this album.

2. **Share the Album with Another Google Account**
   - Share the newly created album with another Google account (this could be your secondary email ID).
   - Make sure you have access to the shared Google account.

3. **Download the Album from the Shared Account**
   - Log in to the secondary Google account (the one with which the album was shared).
   - Open Google Photos in this account, and navigate to the shared album.
   - Select and download the entire album from the shared account.

4. **Verify Metadata**
   - When you download the album this way, the photos should come with all the original metadata (such as creation dates, geolocation, etc.) intact.
   - I’ve tested this method month by month to verify that the metadata is preserved correctly.

## Why This Method?
Unlike Google Takeout, this method seems to preserve the photo metadata because Google handles the shared albums in a different way internally. You won’t need to manually match or recreate metadata after downloading.

## Limitations
- **Monthly Download Tested**: I’ve only tested this method on a monthly basis, so I can't confirm if the same behavior applies to very large albums or albums containing your entire photo library.
- **Time-Consuming**: Depending on the number of photos, this process might take more time than using Google Takeout, but the benefit is that your photos are downloaded with all metadata intact.

## Conclusion
By following this method, you can ensure that the downloaded photos retain their original metadata. If you're trying to archive your Google Photos or move them to a different storage solution, this can be a much better option than using Google Takeout.

Feel free to experiment further with larger albums, and let me know if you find any new insights!
